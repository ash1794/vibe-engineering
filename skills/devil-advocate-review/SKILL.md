# vibe-devil-advocate-review

Before shipping a recommendation, challenge it. The goal is to find weaknesses BEFORE they become production incidents.

## When to Use This Skill

- Before sending a design document for approval
- Before shipping a recommendation that combines multiple inputs
- Before merging a large feature branch
- When you feel "too confident" about a solution
- User asks for a review or second opinion

## When NOT to Use This Skill

- Trivial changes (typo fixes, formatting)
- When the user explicitly says "just ship it"
- During brainstorming (don't kill ideas before they form)
- For code review of small PRs (use `vibe-quality-loop` instead)

## The 5 Dimensions

Challenge the work across:

1. **Consistency** — Do all parts agree with each other? Are there contradictions?
2. **Completeness** — What's missing? What edge cases are unaddressed? What blind spots exist?
3. **Actionability** — Is every recommendation concrete and measurable? Can someone actually do this?
4. **Alignment** — Does this match the stated goals, constraints, and user needs?
5. **Risk** — What could go wrong? What are the second-order effects? What's the blast radius of failure?

## Steps

1. **Read the artifact** thoroughly — don't skim
2. **For each dimension**, actively try to find problems. Assume there ARE problems.
3. **Score each dimension** 1-5 (1=critical issues, 5=solid)
4. **List specific issues** with evidence
5. **Deliver verdict**: APPROVE / REVISE (with required changes) / REJECT (with blocking issues)
